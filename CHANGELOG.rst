Changelog
=========

**Release 1.5.5**

Software:

* Toolchain:

  * Updated to ``waf-2.0.14`` (from ``waf-2.0.13``)

* Bugfixes:

  * fixed UART Frame Error with floating RX pin by enabling Pull-Up
  * fixed a bug, that read wrong wrong entry from database when checking
    battery system current against SOF limits
  * fixed a bug, that flag ``SPI transmit_ongoing`` flag was reset after
    SPI dummy byte was transmitted. This lead to invalid measured cell voltages
    if the daisy-chain was too long
  * enabled simultaneous measurement of V_bat and MCU temperature in ADC module
  * fixed temperature calculation in ADC module
  * fixed a bug, that balancing threshold for voltage-based balancing was set
    not in function ``BAL_Activate_Balancing_Voltage`` but in bal statemachine


* Enhancements:

  * database entries are initialized with 0 to prevent undefined data if
    entries are read before valid values are written into the database

Hardware:

* Slave 18-cell v1.1.5

  * EMI layout improvements
  * adapted component variants to other changes
  * replaced DC/DC converter power inductor with AEC-Q compliant one
  * added circuit for switching off DC/DC converters in LTC sleep mode

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Release 1.5.4**

* Bugfixes:

  * In BMS module, wait time between error request to contactors and open
    request to interlock was increased. Otherwise, interlock opened before
    contactors were open. If this is the case, both contactors open at the
    same time without any delay between first and second contactor.
  * Fixed error in reading of interlock feedback.

    never updated.
  * rewrite of struct ``DIAG_RETURNTYPE_e``. The enumeration had
    non-consecutive numbering and potentially dangerous typo in duplicate enum
    (``DIAG_HANDLER_RETURN_ERR_OCCURED = 2`` and
    ``DIAG_HANDLER_RETURN_ERR_OCCURRED = 4``).
  * fixed a bug, that diagnosis entry for a voltage violation of the maximimum
    safety limit wrote to wrong database entry.

by the define SLAVE_BOARD_VERSION and for the secondary MCU in
foxBMS-secondary\src\module\config\ltc_cfg.h by the define SLAVE_BOARD_VERSION.

* Set SLAVE_BOARD_VERSION to "1" if you are using version 1.xx of the foxBMS
  Slave.
* Set SLAVE_BOARD_VERSION to "2" if you are using version 2.xx of the foxBMS
  Slave. Version 2.xx is the default configuration.

A new project structure is now used by foxBMS. The documentation is no more
contained in the embedded software sources and has its own repository. FreeRTOS
and hal have their own repository, too.
A central repository called foxBMS-setup is now used. It contains
several scripts:


* bootstrap.py gets all the repositories needed to work with foxBMS

  and parameters

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Release 0.4.4**

The checksum tool is now automatically called when building binaries.
Therefore the command
``python tools/waf-1.8.12 configure build chksum``
is NOT longer supported. The command to build binaries with checksum support is
``python tools/waf-1.8.12 configure build``
This is the build command used in foxBMS FrontDesk, that is, FrontDesk software
is compatible with this change and now supports automatic checksum builds.

Release notes:

* Improved checksum-feature
* Updated copyright 2010 - 2017

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Release 0.4.3**

Starting from this version, a checksum mechanism was implemented in foxBMS. If
the checksum is active and it is not computed correctly, it will prevent the
flashed program from running. Details on deactivating the checksum can be found
in the Software FAQ, in How to use and deactivate the checksum.

Release notes:


* Important: Changed contactor configuration order in the software to match
  the labels on the front

  * Contactor 0: CONT_PLUS_MAIN
  * Contactor 1: CONT_PLUS_PRECHARGE
  * Contactor 2: CONT_MINUS_MAIN

* Fixed an bug which could cause an unintended closing of the contactors after
  recovering from error mode
* Increased stack size for the engine tasks to avoid stack overflow in some
  special conditions
* Added a note in the documentation to indicate the necessity to send a
  periodic CAN message to the BMS
* Fixed DLC of CAN message for the current sensor measurement
* Added checksum verification for the flashed binaries
* Updated linker script to allow integration of the checksum tool
* Activated debug without JTAG interface via USB

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
